### Red tape slows business down.

For the past ten years the Canadian Federation of Independent Business has studied and reported on the impact government red tape has on business. Red tape means lower incomes, less economic growth and hundreds of thousands of hours and billions of dollars are wasted every year. The annual cost of all regulations on businesses in Canada is pegged at $37 billion per year, with one-third of that ($11 billion) considered red tape, according to a 2015 report by CFIB.
