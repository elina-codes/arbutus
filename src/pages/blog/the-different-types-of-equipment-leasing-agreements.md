Are you a business owner considering equipment leasing for your business? Equipment leasing can be a great option for businesses of all sizes to get access to the latest technology without having to pay the full cost upfront. But navigating all the different types of equipment leases and agreements available can seem intimidating and overwhelming. Fortunately, understanding everything there is to know about these options doesn’t have to be complicated—in this blog, we'll go over the main types of equipment lease agreements so that you can make an informed decision on what's best for your business.

## Overview of Equipment Leasing Agreements

A leasing agreement allows a company to rent equipment for a certain length of time, typically with the option to purchase the item at the end of the term. This approach provides many benefits, including the ability to conserve cash flow, enjoy tax benefits, and avoid the hassle of equipment obsolescence. However, there are some key considerations that any business should keep in mind when entering into a leasing agreement. The experienced and knowledgeable advisors at Arbutus Capital can help navigate these complex agreements and ensure that the terms are favorable for the business.

## Operating Lease Agreements

An operating lease agreement is a contractual agreement between a lessee and a lessor in which the lessee rents a particular asset for a specific period. This type of lease is ideal for businesses that require equipment for a temporary period of time without the commitment of ownership. Unlike a finance lease, operating leases consist of lower rental payments as the asset does not transfer ownership to the lessee. Another notable advantage of operating leases is that payments are treated as operating expenses, allowing businesses to deduct the lease payments from their taxes. With the benefits of renting necessary equipment at a lower cost with tax-deductible payments, it is no surprise that many businesses opt for operating lease agreements over purchasing assets outright.

## Capital Lease Agreements

A capital lease agreement is a type of lease in which the lessee obtains the rights to use an asset for a specific period of time while assuming the risks and benefits of ownership. To identify a capital lease agreement, you should look for certain characteristics including a transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term, a long-term agreement, and terms that favor the lessee rather than the lessor. This type of lease offers several advantages for the lessee such as the ability to capitalize the asset and record it on their balance sheet, potential tax benefits, and lower monthly payments compared to purchasing the asset outright. If you are considering entering into a lease agreement, understanding the differences between a capital lease and an operating lease can help you make an informed decision that best fits your business needs.

## Sale and Leaseback Agreements

A Sale and Leaseback Agreement is a popular financial strategy used by companies to free up capital tied up in their assets. Under this agreement, a company sells its assets, such as property or equipment, to a third party and then leases it back from them for a predetermined period. This allows the company to access the cash from the sale while still being able to use the assets for their operations. This strategy can be particularly useful for companies with valuable but underutilized assets in need of capital or businesses looking to reduce their balance sheet liabilities. By utilizing a Sale and Leaseback Agreement, companies can reallocate their resources towards growth opportunities while still maintaining the use of their assets.

## How to choose the right equipment leasing agreement

When considering an equipment leasing agreement, it's important to make the right choice. With so many options available, it can be intimidating to know where to begin. First, start by carefully assessing your needs and budget. Consider what equipment you need and how long you will need it for. From there, research different leasing companies and compare their rates and terms.
