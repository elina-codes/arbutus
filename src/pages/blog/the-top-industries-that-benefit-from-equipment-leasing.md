Are you a business owner looking to expand your operations, but unsure of how best to do so? Equipment leasing can be an excellent solution for tapping into the resources you need. By working with a trusted and reliable leasing partner, you'll be able to access the equipment that will benefit your business. In addition, you'll enjoy greater financial flexibility while keeping expenses more manageable. With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at some of the top [industries we work with](https://arbutuscapital.com/industries) that can gain significant advantages from equipment leasing partnerships.

## Transportation 

Given Canada’s vast land mass, the transportation sector plays a vital role in our country’s growing economy by linking people to jobs and products to consumers. The [transportation industry](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/why-choose-arbutus-capital-for-your-vehicle-leasing-needs-in-ontario/) relies heavily on trucks, trailers, and vans to deliver goods to their destinations efficiently. Instead of purchasing these expensive vehicles outright, it's possible to lease them and avoid the upfront costs. Leasing can help transportation companies expand their fleet without breaking the bank, plus there are the added benefits of flexible terms and the ability to upgrade to newer equipment at the end of the term. By leasing, transportation companies can focus on their bottom line while maintaining a fleet of top vehicles. It's a smart way to [stay competitive](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/how-commercial-truck-leasing-can-help-ontario-businesses-stay-competitive/) in an industry that demands constant innovation and optimization.

## Construction

Just like the transportation industry, the construction industry is always changing, and [construction companies](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/construction-equipment-leasing-our-hassle-free-solution/) need to stay competitive with state of the art technology and heavy machinery. With new building materials and technology, having the right equipment to adapt to these changes is crucial — and this equipment is expensive. Fortunately, there is a way to do this without breaking the bank. By leasing equipment such as cranes, hoists, and lifts instead of purchasing them outright, companies working on large scale projects can maintain up to date equipment and technology without incurring the costs of ownership. You can lease trailers to haul building materials when transportation needs are required for construction purposes. For landscaping, road construction, residential or commercial land development, you can lease excavators, skid steers, bobcats, compactors, and everything in between to get the job done. 

Leasing heavy machinery allows for flexible terms to be negotiated and for quick access to a wide range of equipment. With the right leasing terms, construction companies can remain agile in unpredictable markets by only paying for what they need based on their current jobs, and avoiding the hassle of outdated machinery.

## Forestry

Forestry is an essential component of Canada's economy, contributing significantly to providing the global market with raw materials as well as manufactured products such as lumber, paper and timber. With this key industry requiring specialized equipment for logging and manufacturing, companies can opt to lease the required equipment instead of purchasing it outright. This solution is a cost-effective way for businesses to access the necessary tools and machinery, allowing them to operate more efficiently and meet the demand for their product. As a result, leasing equipment has become a popular option for forestry companies in Canada, helping to support this vital industry's growth and success.

## Hospitality 

To keep up with customer demands and deliver top-notch service, restaurants and hotels can lease equipment that will help them run a smooth operation in their kitchens. From high-quality ovens to state-of-the-art refrigeration systems, there are several options to choose from when looking for kitchen equipment to support your restaurant or hotel. Point of Sale (POS) systems, audio/visual systems and draft beer systems are also pieces of equipment that come with a hefty up-front price tag, but when leased instead, can give your business a competitive edge without affecting your cash flow. 

The benefits of leasing equipment are numerous, including cost-effectiveness and increased convenience. Not only can you save money by leasing equipment instead of buying it outright, but you can also benefit from having the latest technology and systems at your disposal. By leasing high-quality equipment, you can ensure that your establishment stays ahead of the competition and delivers a memorable dining experience to your customers.

## Healthcare & Fitness

The [health and wellness industry](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/equipment-leasing-for-health-wellness-facilities-what-you-need-to-know/) is a constantly evolving field where having the most up-to-date and advanced equipment can be crucial. However, purchasing new medical equipment can be expensive and not always feasible for healthcare facilities, especially for temporary needs. This is where leasing equipment can offer a great solution. Leasing allows healthcare providers to access the latest and most advanced technology without the hefty price tag that comes with purchasing outright. By leasing equipment, healthcare facilities can save money while still being able to provide the best possible care to their patients. Additionally, leasing offers flexibility, allowing healthcare providers to adjust their equipment needs based on the specific demands of their practice.  

The fitness industry has been rapidly growing in Canada, with an estimated worth of $6.2 billion in Canada, and businesses that want to keep up with the pace need to adjust their game plans. One of the ways to achieve this is by leasing fitness equipment, which has become a highly popular trend among established gyms and health clubs. With the demand for new and advanced exercise machinery on the rise, leasing can provide businesses with the opportunity to try out and use the latest equipment without breaking the bank. From cardio machines to strength equipment, leasing allows businesses to conserve their cash while still providing the best possible workout experience for their customers.



In conclusion, equipment leasing is a great option for businesses in many different industries. It can help transportation companies save money, construction crews access the right tools for the job, and restaurants and hotels upgrade their offerings without having to invest in costly equipment. Similarly, healthcare facilities can rent medical equipment as needed and fitness centers can keep up with the current trends in this growing industry. All of this combines to offer flexibility and savings that companies wouldn’t necessarily have access to otherwise.
