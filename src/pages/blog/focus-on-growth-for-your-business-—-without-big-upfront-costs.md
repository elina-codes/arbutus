Starting up a business, or investing in its growth, has its challenges — especially when it comes to the big tools you need to do your work. Purchasing equipment for your business comes hand-in-hand with large upfront costs, which may not be feasible for your current financial situation and cash flow. 

With Arbutus Capital, you can obtain new equipment through a lease instead of a purchase that'll help propel your success without breaking the bank. We provide flexible leasing solutions and services tailored to fit a variety of industries. Keep reading to learn more about how equipment leasing works and how we make it easier for your business to focus on what really matters — growth!

## What is equipment leasing?

[Equipment leasing](https://arbutuscapital.com/why-lease) is a financial agreement where your business can rent machinery or tools from a leasing company instead of purchasing them outright or acquiring a high-interest loan to make that purchase. The leasing company retains ownership of the equipment, while your business pays a monthly lease amount instead of a lump-sum purchase cost. 

Equipment leasing is commonly used by businesses that require expensive equipment, but cannot afford the hefty purchasing costs upfront. Leasing offers several advantages, including tailored payment terms, tax benefits, and the ability to upgrade equipment instead of being stuck with outdated equipment. 

## Benefits of equipment leasing

Equipment leasing offers five main benefits for businesses of all sizes:

* Leasing allows companies to preserve cash flow by avoiding large upfront costs associated with equipment purchases. 
* Leasing offers flexibility as equipment can be returned or upgraded at the end of the leasing term without incurring excessive expenses — you can also choose to purchase the equipment at the end of the term, if desired. 
* Leasing enables businesses to stay up-to-date with the latest technological advancements in their industry. 
* Equipment leasing offers tax advantages as monthly lease payments can be deducted from taxable income. 
* Leasing provides businesses with greater financial control and predictability as monthly lease payments are fixed and predictable, making it easier for businesses to plan and budget for the future.

Ultimately, equipment leasing presents a viable and attractive option for businesses looking to stay competitive, maintain cash flow, and achieve long-term success. This especially rings true if you are a small business or start-up, as it allows you to have better control over your cash flow and start becoming profitable sooner.

## How equipment leasing helps you save money

For many businesses, equipment leasing has become an increasingly popular financing option. Not only does it allow companies to access the latest and greatest equipment without paying the full purchase price upfront, but it can also help save money over the long term. Being able to save money and have cash reserves is crucial for the future of your business. 

How? When you lease equipment, you typically pay a fixed monthly payment for a set period of time, which means you can budget more effectively and avoid unexpected costs related to your equipment. Ultimately, equipment leasing can help you save money by allowing you to invest in the tools you need to grow your business without breaking the bank.

## Tips to maximize your equipment leasing experience

Leasing equipment can be a smart move for companies looking to maximize their resources and stay competitive. However, in order to make the most of your leasing experience, it's important to keep a few key tips in mind. Start by auditing your current equipment and anticipated needs — will anything need to be replaced soon? How do you expect your business to grow in the future, and what will you need to make that happen? Are you expanding into different areas, or only requiring certain equipment for a short term?

To maximize your equipment leasing experience, choose a leasing company like Arbutus Capital with a strong reputation and clear payment terms.
