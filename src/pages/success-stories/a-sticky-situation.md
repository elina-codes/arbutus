When the operator of a leased truck is on the road with a breakdown, and there is insufficient cash or credit to cover expensive repairs, it’s a problem for everyone involved. Financing equipment repairs through sale-leasebacks or lease amendments are two ways Arbutus can help our trucking clients get the repair they need to keep their equipment rolling. Read on for Jim's story.

### **Stuck in Wyoming**

Jim is a seasoned single owner-operator long-haul trucker and a customer of Arbutus’ since 2005.  He called us on a Monday afternoon stuck in Wyoming with a broken down transmission and a repair quote to get his truck on our lease repaired.  Knowing time was of the essence to get him back on the road we approved him for the repairs before day’s end.

**Here is how it worked:**

* The lease was amended to cover the repairs
* We sent documents to him electronically
* Jim signed and scanned them back to us before the end of the following day  
* The US repair shop was paid
* Our lessee was back on the road less than 48 hours after making the distress call

**Jim told us:**

> “I didn’t think Arbutus would be willing to help. But you had me going within 48 hours. Arbutus was right there for me.  The service is second to none.”

### **Getting back on the road**

Financing repairs are one thing that separates Arbutus Capital from most other lenders. 

The business of being a trucker is often a challenging one.  Arbutus Capital’s mission when our lessee’s truck experiences a major breakdown is to get them back on the road as soon as possible to minimize the disruption of their receivables.  Although not always able to make it happen as fast as we did for Jim, we will always do our best to keep our customers working and our truckers on the road.

**Jim’s experience is summed up in his feedback to us:**

> “Arbutus is there for me. The best company I ever dealt with for equipment financing. When I phone and talk to Mike or Joey, they know who I am.  They don’t treat you like a number. “

Limiting red tape and long delays in funding decision making are just two of the many ways we make equipment leasing with Arbutus Capital a positive choice for your business.
