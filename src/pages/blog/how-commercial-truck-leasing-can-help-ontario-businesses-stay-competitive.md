Ontario businesses reported higher growth in 2022 than over the previous two years, with many forecasting [even more growth in 2023](https://occ.ca/interactive-oer2023/). But running a successful business and seeing business growth requires a lot of resources, particularly in the transportation sector. If you run a business based in Ontario, you understand how important it is to maintain a competitive edge. For businesses in the transportation industry, commercial truck leasing can provide significant cost savings and operational advantages. In this blog post, we’ll take a closer look at how commercial truck leasing can help Ontario businesses stay competitive and thrive in today’s market, as well as factors to consider when choosing a leasing company.

## Benefits of Commercial Truck Leasing

### Lower upfront costs

Compared to purchasing a truck, commercial truck leasing generally does not require the large upfront investment of buying the vehicle outright. This can be a major advantage for businesses that are just starting out, or that do not have a large amount of capital available. Instead of tying up your resources in a single truck, you can use your funds for other important operational costs, such as marketing and hiring. And when you lease a truck, you’re essentially renting it for a set period of time, without having to pay the full purchase price. That means you can take advantage of newer, more fuel-efficient trucks without having to make a huge investment up front.

### Improved Cash Flow

Commercial truck leasing can also help improve your business’s cash flow. Since leasing requires smaller, regular payments, businesses can free up their cash flow to reinvest in other areas of their operations. This can be especially beneficial for small businesses and startups that need to allocate limited funds to multiple priorities.

### Access to vehicles

Ensure your business stays competitive and keep your drivers safe on the road. Breakdowns are abundant in the trucking sector, and access to parts can be tricky in the current supply chain landscape — which can lead to unwanted downtime for your business. We work with a variety of vendors to make sure you get the equipment you need fast once your lease is approved.

### Flexibility

One of the most important advantages of commercial truck leasing is its flexibility. Unlike owning a truck, a lease allows businesses to adjust their fleet to meet their changing needs. This means that if you experience a sudden increase in demand, you can adjust your fleet size accordingly without having to worry too much about long-term financial commitments or resale value.

Additionally, you don’t have to worry about being stuck with a truck that is no longer the right fit for your business. When your lease ends, you can easily return the truck and choose a new one that meets your current needs.

### Tax advantages

In Ontario, commercial truck leasing can provide tax advantages to businesses. Lease payments are considered to be operating expenses and can be deducted from your taxes, reducing your overall tax burden. Additionally, leasing a truck allows you to avoid the large depreciation expenses that come with owning a vehicle outright, further reducing your overall tax liability. You may also be responsible for less tax paperwork when you lease, since you don’t own the asset outright. 

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Commercial Truck Lease

When choosing to lease commercial trucks for your business, there are a few things you should consider. First, determine what type of truck and the size of the fleet you would need. How long will you need access to this fleet, and do you anticipate your needs changing? What is your budget, and how is your current cash flow? These are all important questions to answer when partnering with a company on a commercial truck lease, and once these are defined, it’s time to [research a leasing company](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/shopping-around-for-your-equipment-learn-why-arbutus-capital-is-your-one-stop-shop/).

Commercial truck leasing with Arbutus Capital allows you to finance the use of a vehicle for the term of the lease.

This is unlike a vehicle loan in which you finance the purchase of a vehicle for outright ownership. For businesses that need commercial vehicles to build a fleet, commercial leasing creates the opportunity to acquire these vehicles without a considerable cash output and without the liabilities of ownership that come with a traditional loan model.
