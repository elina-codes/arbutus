    content: `If you lease equipment from us, you are allowed to return the equipment to Arbutus if you wish. However, most business owners take advantage of the end-of-term Purchase Option on their lease as it rarely makes sense to return the equipment.  They'll find it will either disrupt their workflow or because the equipment is worth more than the Purchase Option amount. If they need to upgrade they often buy out their equipment using the Purchase Option, then trade their existing equipment in at a dealer for newer or different equipment.
