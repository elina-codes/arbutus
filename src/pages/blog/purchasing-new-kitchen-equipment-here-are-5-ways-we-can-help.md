Are you considering purchasing new kitchen equipment for your business? With the increasing costs of purchasing quality kitchen appliances, it can be a daunting task to ensure that you get the most value for your money. Luckily, there is an alternative way to get top-of-the-line equipment without breaking the bank —- leasing! Leasing helps you avoid upfront costs and keep your business plans on track without having a negative impact on your cash flow. 

If you’ve just opened a restaurant, cafe or catering business, we understand how important it is to have reliable and efficient kitchen machinery in place to make it a success. In this blog, we explore five reasons why equipment leasing with Arbutus Capital can help make acquiring new kitchen equipment simple and stress free!

## Flexible payment options

Leasing kitchen equipment allows you to pay for your equipment over a set amount of time, instead of all at once. This makes the process much easier on your wallet by reducing upfront purchasing costs, and also helps ensure you stay within your monthly budget. You can also choose lease terms that best suit your needs and financial situation, allowing for more flexibility. This makes lease agreements much more suitable for businesses with fluctuating cash flow — which is very true of many restaurants and food-related businesses! From POS systems to ovens and other kitchen equipment, Arbutus Capital works with you to develop a payment plan that keeps your costs affordable. 

## Tax advantages

With equipment leasing, you not only get access to the kitchen equipment your business needs, you’ll also gain tax advantages. Depending on how the CRA classifies your lease agreement, your payments may be tax deductible as a business operating expense. When you purchase an item, you pay all your taxes upfront, but taxes are paid monthly with a lease, which can help you offset the overall cost of your equipment. 

## Keep up with the latest technology

Things can change fast in the hospitality industry, but keeping up with the latest technology no longer has to be expensive and time consuming. With Arbutus Capital's equipment leasing solutions, you can get the upgrade you need without having to purchase new equipment. This allows businesses to upgrade their equipment when needed so they can stay ahead of the curve with emerging technologies, which gives them an advantage in the competitive restaurant landscape. 

Some pieces of equipment may last for the life of your business and need less frequent upgrades, but are expensive to purchase up-front. Thus, you also have purchase options for the equipment at the end of your lease term, if desired — after all, it’s already installed in your kitchen!

## Reduce Maintenance Costs

Having a busy restaurant or catering business can take a toll on your kitchen equipment. With our equipment leasing solutions, we ensure businesses never have to worry about replacing worn out components or losing money on maintaining broken parts. You can enjoy new functioning equipment on our lease terms without the stress of repairing or replacing it—the older the equipment gets, the more money you have to put into maintaining it. At the end of your lease, you can enjoy the freedom to upgrade to a brand new piece of equipment.
