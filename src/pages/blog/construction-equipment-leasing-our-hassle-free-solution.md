At Arbutus Capital, we understand the financial strains businesses of all sizes face, which is why we're committed to making life easier by offering a seamless and cost-effective alternative.

Being time-efficient and scalable, our leasing options allow you to focus on what truly matters — completing your projects on time and within budget. 

## Benefits of Leasing Construction Equipment

When you're about to dive into a major construction project, there's a lot riding on the line, including deciding whether leasing or purchasing equipment is the best move for you. Leasing can be a lifesaver when cash flow is tight, so instead of a large upfront investment, you're looking at periodic smaller payments. For example,  heavy machinery such as backhoe-loaders could cost anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000 or more. That same equipment could be leased with a much lower monthly cost. Equipment leasing also keeps your credit lines open, allowing you to approach other capital requirements with a swagger in your step. 

Now, let's not forget to mention that equipment upgrades are way smoother when you lease. You can keep pace with the latest and greatest technology at the end

of your lease instead of being stuck with outdated machinery you’ve purchased. Wrap this up with reduced maintenance and upkeep costs, as well as  tax advantages, and you're looking at a pretty sweet deal!
