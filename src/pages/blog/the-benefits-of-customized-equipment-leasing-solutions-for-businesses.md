## What is Customized Equipment Leasing?

An equipment lease agreement is a contractual document that defines the agreed upon terms of our deal: term, payment, conditions, end-of-term purchase option, etc. Customized equipment leasing is quickly becoming a popular solution for businesses that need access to specialized equipment. This type of agreement allows companies to rent necessary equipment on a flexible timeline that suits their specific needs. 



The beauty of customized equipment leasing lies in the fact that businesses can tailor agreements to their own requirements, allowing them to scale up or down quickly as necessary. With lower upfront costs and the option to upgrade equipment as technology advances, this model also makes financial sense for businesses looking to manage their budget effectively. By embracing customized equipment leasing, businesses can access the latest technology without the risks and costs of ownership, all while benefiting from the flexibility these agreements provide.

The world of equipment leasing can be a tricky one to navigate. For businesses looking to acquire new machinery or technology, trying to secure a lease can seem like an overwhelming chore.

Whether you need to lease a single piece of equipment or an entire fleet, Arbutus Capital has over forty years of expertise to help you get the job done. 

Our lease contracts stipulate monthly lease payments throughout your set term. However, if this is something that may cause issues for your business for whatever reason, we ask that you let us know in advance of any approval we provide. That way, we can determine how to best work with the seasonal nature of your business to find a solution that will work for both of us.

## Different Types of Leases

When it comes to leasing, Arbutus Capital has a variety of options to fit every individual's needs. It's important to consider all options and choose the option that is the best fit for your specific situation and needs. We are ready to assist and guide you through the process.

Leasing keeps your financial statements healthy. A lease is written as a rental agreement, and in many cases, 100% of the monthly rental can be written off as a business expense on your financial statements, rather than a depreciating asset. Talk to your accountant about the potential benefits and what you may qualify for.

What’s the difference between a capital lease and operating lease? A capital lease refers to a lease for an asset which is financed for most of its useful life and is consequently reported as a liability on the lessee's financial statements. An operating lease, in contrast, refers to a lease for an asset which is financed for less than its useful life and can be either returned to the lessor or purchased outright at the end of the lease term. An operating lease is consequently not capitalized on a lessee's books, providing the opportunity for it to be an off-balance sheet financing alternative.

At the end of your lease, you may exercise the Purchase Option or return the equipment to Arbutus. Most business owners take advantage of the end-of-term Purchase Option because the equipment is worth more than the Purchase Option amount, or because returning the equipment to Arbutus would disrupt their workflow. If cash flow is an issue, we also have a sale-leaseback option. This is when you already own the equipment, but we purchase your equipment and lease it back to you over time.
