## An Overview of Equipment Leasing in Saskatchewan

Leasing equipment has become a popular option for businesses in Saskatchewan looking to grow their operations. With economic growth being a top priority for the province, leasing provides a cost-effective alternative to purchasing equipment outright. This can be especially beneficial for industries such as manufacturing, [construction](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/construction-equipment-leasing-our-hassle-free-solution/), and mining, which require specialized and often expensive equipment. With the high cost of purchasing manufacturing equipment, leasing provides a cost-effective solution that allows manufacturers to access the latest technology without the large upfront expense. The same goes for the construction industry, where equipment such as excavators and bulldozers come with hefty price tags. By leasing equipment, construction businesses can free up capital that can be used for other expenses, such as hiring new workers or expanding their operations. 

Ultimately, the variety of equipment available for lease makes it a viable option for businesses across a range of industries, contributing to the continued growth and success of Saskatchewan.

## Benefits of Leasing vs Buying Equipment

When it comes to acquiring equipment, businesses have the option to either buy or lease it. While buying may seem like the more traditional route, leasing actually brings about [numerous benefits](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/8-ways-businesses-benefit-from-equipment-leasing/). For one, it can offer significant cost savings since leasing involves lower upfront costs compared to purchasing. Additionally, leasing provides businesses with greater [flexibility](https://arbutuscapital.com/blog/the-benefits-of-customized-equipment-leasing-solutions-for-businesses/) since they can upgrade or replace equipment more frequently without having to worry about finding buyers for their old equipment. Leasing also comes with tax benefits, as lease payments may be deducted as a business expense. Furthermore, leasing guarantees that businesses have access to the latest technology as equipment can be swapped out for newer models at the end of each lease term. Overall, leasing offers several advantages over buying, making it a viable option for businesses looking to stay competitive in today's ever-changing market.

## Types of Equipment Leases

When it comes to leasing, Arbutus Capital has a variety of options to fit every individual's needs. It's important to consider all options and choose the option that is the best fit for your specific situation and needs. We are ready to assist and guide you through the process.



A capital lease refers to a lease for an asset which is financed for most of its useful life and is consequently reported as a liability on the lessee's financial statements. An operating lease, in contrast, refers to a lease for an asset which is financed for less than its useful life and can be either returned to the lessor or purchased outright at the end of the lease term. An operating lease is consequently not capitalized on a lessee's books, providing the opportunity for it to be an off-balance sheet financing alternative.



At the end of your lease, you may exercise our Purchase Option or return the equipment to Arbutus. If cash flow is an issue, we also have a sale-leaseback option. This is when you already own the equipment, but we purchase your equipment and lease it back to you over time —  a useful option for those looking to improve their cash position in a hurry.
